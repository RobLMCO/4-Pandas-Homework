Heroes Of Pymoli Data Analysis

Three Observable Trends;

1)	Of the 780 purchases in the supplied data file, there are 576 unique players identified having purchased one or more of the 183 unique items. 84% of the unique players are Male. While Male’s made a total of 652 purchases, the average purchase by a Male is slightly lower than female buyers or those of other non-disclosed gender.  
2)	Around 67% of items purchased are by 66% of the players, aged between 15 and 24 years old. These purchases total over $1600, or 67% of the total purchases, at the average price of $3.05 per item. So, about two thirds of sales are single purchases of no more than $3 by players aged between 15 and 24 years old. 
3)	The top spenders buy 3 to 5 items valued between $2.50 and $3.86 per item. While the most popular items sold are valued between $3.50 and $4.90 each, with the top 5 constituting about 7% of the total sales.

Summary;

Based on in-game purchases or game store sales data, mobile games such as League of Legends (or in this case Heroes Of Pymoli) tend to generate at least three times the typical income of $1 purchase price games, where the demographic of least two thirds being males and/or aged between 15 and 24 are willing to pay at least $3 on items to improve their game experience. Less than 10% of in-game purchases exceed $3.50, so while the most popular items may be more profitable, they are less significant compared with sales for $3 items. For Heroes Of Pymoli, there is a clear target audience and value point for in-game/store item sales. But without knowing how many players didn’t buy items over a similar known time frame, it is difficult to determine if item purchases are actually relevant to the total game revenue (incomplete information).
